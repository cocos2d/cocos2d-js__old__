## Vision of cocos2d-console


A command line tool that lets you create, run, publish, debug, etcâ€¦ your game. It is the swiss-army knife for cocos2d.

This command line tool is in its early stages.

Examples:

```
# starts a new project called "My Game" for iOS and Android with JS Bindigns
$ cocos2d new "My Game" --mobile --js

$ cd "My Game"

# Will compile the source code, publish the assests, and then it will send the binary to the simulator
$ cocos2d run --ios


# Will generate a distribution .ipa file ready to be summitted to the App Store
$ cocos2d dist --ios


# Will generate published files
$ cocos2d publish --ios

```
# Will generate bytecode files
$ ./jscompile.py -d output4 -s cocos2dx_root/scripting/javascript/bindings/js -s cocos2dx_root/samples/Javascript/Shared/tests -o main.js -j compiler_config_sample.json -c

```
